# Playbook: Install and configure MariaDB
# This playbook targets hosts in the `db` group and performs basic
# installation and configuration steps required to run MariaDB for
# a simple web application.

    # Install the MariaDB server package. On Debian/Ubuntu this is

    # may differ. Adjust as needed.

    # Install the PyMySQL library so Ansible's MySQL/MariaDB modules
    # can connect using Python on the control/target host. Package
    # name may vary between distributions.
